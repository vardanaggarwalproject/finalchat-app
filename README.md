#  Real-Time Chat Application  
## End-to-End Chat System with Group Chat & Real-Time Presence

This project focuses on learning and building how real-time conversations work in the modern world — how a message travels instantly from one user to another.

---

## Overview

In traditional applications, communication happens using **HTTP-based web transporters**, which are not ideal for real-time interactions.

Today, technologies like **Socket.IO** upgrade this experience by enabling:

- Full-duplex communication  
- Bi-directional data transfer  
- Real-time message delivery  
- Minimal latency for instant updates  

This project demonstrates these concepts through a fully functional real-time chat system.

##  Features

### Real-Time One-to-One Messaging
Instant delivery of messages between two users using Socket.IO.

###  Group Chat via Rooms
- Each group chat is implemented using **Socket.IO rooms**.  
- Messages are broadcast only to members of that room.  
- All room participants immediately receive new messages.

###  Real-Time User Profile Updates
Users can update their profile, and changes automatically reflect across connected clients.

###  Live Active / Inactive User Status
The system shows the user's real-time presence:
- Online  
- Offline
- Active  
- Inactive

##  Learning Goals

Through this project, I explored:

- How real-time communication works in modern applications  
- How messages travel between server and clients  
- How Socket.IO improves communication over traditional web transporters  
- How group chat works using room-based broadcasting  
- How to manage user presence and live updates efficiently
